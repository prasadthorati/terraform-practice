What are Terraform Local Variables?
In Terraform, local variables are a way to simplify and reduce repetition in your configuration files. They allow you to define reusable values that are computed once and used throughout your configuration. These variables are defined in a locals block and are not exposed to the outside like input variables.

Why Use Local Variables?
To avoid repeating expressions.
To improve readability and maintainability.
To centralize the logic for computed values.
Syntax for Defining Local Variables
Local variables are defined using the locals block, which contains key-value pairs.


Explanation of the Example
Local Variables Defined:

environment: Represents the deployment environment (e.g., dev).
region: Specifies the AWS region (e.g., us-east-1).
bucket_name: Dynamically constructs the S3 bucket name using the environment variable.
common_tags: A map of key-value pairs used as tags for resources.
Provider Block: The local.region variable is used to configure the AWS provider.

Resource Block:

local.bucket_name is used to set the bucket name.
local.common_tags is used for tagging the S3 bucket.
Output
You can use the output block to verify the values of local variables.

Benefits of Using Local Variables
Simplifies Configuration: Centralizes frequently used or computed values.
Reduces Errors: Eliminates repetitive hard-coded values, reducing the chance of inconsistencies.
Improves Scalability: Easier to scale or modify configurations.
